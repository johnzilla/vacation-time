# Testing "View Details" Functionality

## Steps to test:
1. Open the app at http://localhost:5174/
2. Set available vacation days to 20 and used to 5 (leaving 15 days)
3. Set target consecutive days to 7
4. Look at the recommendations
5. Click "View Details" on any recommendation
6. Verify that:
   - The vacation period is highlighted on the calendar
   - The calendar navigates to the appropriate view (month/quarter/year)
   - The vacation dates are clearly visible and colored appropriately
   - The calendar shows the correct month/period for the recommendation

## Expected behavior:
- Clicking "View Details" should trigger the `handlePlanSelect` function in App.tsx
- This should set `highlightedPeriod` and `navigateToDate` state
- The calendar should automatically switch to the appropriate view based on the span
- The vacation period should be highlighted in blue on the calendar
- On mobile, it should scroll to the calendar section

## Fixed issues:
- Syntax error in CalendarContainer.tsx switch statement has been fixed
- The application now builds successfully
